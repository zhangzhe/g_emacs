My emacs configuration.
I like emacs. After 1 year's use and config, I would like share my configuration.
Can not put all things here. So to use it please make sure cedet, ecb, ruby, rails, rhtml, rinari, rspec, yaml and themes mode all installed.
I will keep improving it.
Anything unclear please email me at gary20071226@gmail.com.
Have fun:)
